## What Is This?

PARVYOM Metanode is an **infrastructure orchestration system** that coordinates blockchain services, storage, compute, and networking across multiple systems. Think of it as a "Kubernetes for blockchain infrastructure" - it manages and coordinates all the moving pieces.

## Key Features

- **Multi-chain coordination** - Orchestrates multiple blockchain systems
- **Enterprise audit trails** - Built-in compliance and audit logging  
- **Decentralized storage** - Distributed data storage across nodes
- **Load balancing** - Intelligent traffic distribution
- **Security-first** - Military-grade encryption and post-quantum crypto
- **Decentralized load balancing**
- **Audit-compliant deployment tracking**

## How It Works

**Two-Layer Architecture:**

1. **BPI Core** - The infrastructure foundation (ports 9001-9007)
2. **BPCI Enterprise** - The orchestration layer (port 8080)

BPCI coordinates everything: consensus, storage, compute, networking, and economics across multiple blockchain systems.

## Current Status (Honest Assessment)

**‚úÖ What Works Now:**
- 600+ Rust packages compile successfully
- 300+ tests pass consistently  
- Web management interface functional
- Multi-chain coordination working
- Enterprise audit trails operational

**üöß What's In Development:**
- Production deployment automation
- Advanced UI/UX improvements
- Documentation and guides
- Community onboarding tools

**‚ö†Ô∏è What This Is:**
- Early-stage functional foundation
- Solo founder experiment (like early Docker/Ethereum)
- Community testing phase
- Not production-ready for enterprises yet

## Quick Start

```bash
# For developers and experimenters only
git clone https://github.com/GlobalSushrut/PARVYOM-metanode.git
cd PARVYOM-metanode

# Build and test (requires Rust 1.88+)
cargo build --workspace --jobs 1
cargo test --workspace --jobs 1 --lib -- --test-threads 1

# Start management interface
cargo run --bin community_installer_web
# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: This is development code, not production-ready. Future production will use `sudo pravyom install os`.
