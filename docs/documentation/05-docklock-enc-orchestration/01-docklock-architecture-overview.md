# DockLock ENC Orchestration Architecture Overview

## Introduction

DockLock ENC (Encrypted Network Computing) Orchestration represents a revolutionary container orchestration platform designed for the Pravyom ecosystem. Unlike traditional container platforms, DockLock provides military-grade security, deterministic execution, and quantum-safe orchestration capabilities integrated with the BPI (Blockchain Protocol Infrastructure) ledger system.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. DockLock Platform Core

The DockLock platform is built around the concept of "Determinism Cages" - secure execution environments that provide reproducible computation with cryptographic verification.

**Key Components:**
- **Determinism Cage**: Main execution environment with seccomp filtering
- **Syscall Filter**: seccomp-based syscall policy enforcement  
- **Witness Recorder**: I/O and non-deterministic syscall result recording
- **RNG Seeder**: Deterministic RNG seed injection and management

**Security Features:**
- Blocks non-deterministic syscalls (gettimeofday, rdtsc, getrandom)
- Records all I/O operations for replay verification
- Injects deterministic RNG seeds for reproducible randomness
- Merkle-izes witness logs for cryptographic verification

### 2. ENC Cluster Manager

The ENC Cluster Manager provides revolutionary orchestration capabilities for BPI nodes, handling cluster replicas, aliases, nodes, and microservice orchestration.

**Architecture Components:**
- **Cluster Registry**: Central node and replica management
- **Agreement Engine**: Handles all agreement types (CUE, BISO, DockLock)
- **Domain Resolver**: Revolutionary http:cg and rootzk protocol support
- **BPI Ledger Client**: Full audit integration with blockchain
- **HTTP Cage**: Secure HTTP proxy with wallet authentication

**Orchestration Features:**
- 100-year future-proofing with simple, impactful architecture
- Auto-scaling and load balancing across cluster nodes
- Quantum cryptography and ZK privacy integration
- Real-time audit trails to BPI ledger

### 3. Container Deployment API

DockLock provides a comprehensive container deployment API that supports multiple agreement types and orchestration patterns.

**Supported Agreement Types:**
- **CUE YAML**: Declarative infrastructure configuration
- **Compose CUE**: Multi-container orchestration
- **CUE Cage**: Deterministic execution environments
- **CUE Tree**: Hierarchical service dependencies
- **DockLock**: Native container specifications
- **BISO Policies**: Business logic and compliance rules
- **Traffic Light**: Pipeline orchestration and control

## Revolutionary Features

### 1. Deterministic Execution

DockLock ensures completely reproducible computation through:

```rust
pub struct DeterminismCage {
    pub config: CageConfig,
    pub syscall_filter: SyscallFilter,
    pub witness_recorder: WitnessRecorder,
    pub rng_seeder: RngSeeder,
}
```

**Determinism Guarantees:**
- Syscall filtering blocks non-deterministic operations
- RNG seed injection provides reproducible randomness
- I/O witness recording enables replay verification
- Merkle tree verification of execution traces

### 2. Military-Grade Security

**Security Architecture:**
- **Seccomp Filtering**: Kernel-level syscall restriction
- **Witness Recording**: Complete I/O audit trails

- **Quantum-Safe Protocols**: Post-quantum cryptography integration

### 3. BPI Ledger Integration

All orchestration activities are audited to the BPI ledger:

```rust
pub struct BpiLedgerClient {
    pub client_id: String,
    pub ledger_endpoints: Vec<String>,
    pub audit_queue: Arc<RwLock<Vec<BpiAuditEntry>>>,
    pub sync_enabled: bool,
}
```

**Audit Events:**
- Cluster creation and node management
- Agreement deployment and execution
- Container lifecycle events
