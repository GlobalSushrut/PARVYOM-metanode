# Bank API Registry System

## Overview

The Bank API Registry System provides comprehensive banking integration capabilities for the BPI ecosystem, enabling secure bank-to-bank settlements, liquidity sharing, and compliance-driven financial operations. This system is specifically designed for the settlement coin (AUR/SC4) economy, completely isolated from the regular gas/rent economy, and provides production-grade banking infrastructure with enterprise-level security and regulatory compliance.

## Core Architecture

### Bank API Integration Engine

The Bank API Integration Engine serves as the central coordination layer for all banking operations:

```rust
pub struct BankApiIntegration {
    /// Settlement coin engine for AUR/SC4 operations
    settlement_engine: Arc<RwLock<SettlementCoinEngine>>,
    /// Registered bank API connections
    bank_apis: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, BankApiConnection>>>,
    /// Active settlement sessions
    active_settlements: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, ActiveSettlement>>>,
    /// Bank API configuration
    config: BankApiConfig,
    /// Settlement metrics and monitoring
    metrics: Arc<RwLock<BankSettlementMetrics>>,
}
```

### Bank Connection Management

Each bank connection is managed through a comprehensive connection structure:

```rust
pub struct BankApiConnection {
    /// Unique bank identifier
    pub bank_id: String,
    /// Bank display name
    pub bank_name: String,
    /// Secure API endpoint URL
    pub api_endpoint: String,
    /// Authentication token for API access
    pub auth_token: String,
    /// Bank licensing and regulatory information
    pub license_info: BankLicenseInfo,
    /// Current connection status
    pub status: ConnectionStatus,
    /// Last successful heartbeat
    pub last_heartbeat: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Supported settlement types
    pub supported_settlements: Vec<SettlementType>,
}
```

### Bank Licensing and Compliance

Banks must provide comprehensive licensing information for regulatory compliance:

```rust
pub struct BankLicenseInfo {
    /// Official license number
    pub license_number: String,
    /// Regulatory authority (e.g., FDIC, OCC, FCA)
    pub regulatory_authority: String,
    /// License expiration date
    pub expires_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Compliance level (Basic, Enhanced, Institutional)
    pub compliance_level: String,
    /// Authorized settlement limits
    pub settlement_limits: SettlementLimits,
}

pub struct SettlementLimits {
    /// Maximum single settlement amount
    pub max_single_settlement: Decimal,
    /// Daily settlement limit
    pub daily_limit: Decimal,
    /// Monthly settlement limit
    pub monthly_limit: Decimal,
    /// Minimum settlement amount
    pub min_settlement: Decimal,
}
```

## Bank-Stamped Wallets

### Enhanced Compliance Wallets

Bank-stamped wallets provide the highest level of compliance and security for banking operations:

```rust
pub struct BankStampedWallet {
    /// Unique wallet identifier
    pub wallet_id: Uuid,
    /// Wallet address on the blockchain
    pub wallet_address: String,
    /// Cryptographic bank stamp
    pub bank_stamp: WalletStamp,
    /// Core infrastructure maintainer ID
    pub core_maintainer_id: String,
    /// Associated banking partner
    pub banking_partner: Option<String>,
    /// Multi-signature requirement flag
    pub multisig_required: bool,
    /// Complete transaction history
    pub transaction_history: Vec<BankTransaction>,
    /// Wallet creation timestamp
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

### Bank Transaction Types

The system supports various banking transaction types with full compliance tracking:

```rust
pub enum BankTransactionType {
    /// Standard transfer between accounts
    Transfer,
    /// Payment processing
    Payment,
    /// Wire transfer (high-value, regulated)
    WireTransfer,
    /// Deposit operations
    Deposit,
    /// Withdrawal operations
    Withdrawal,
    /// Compliance-related fees
    ComplianceFee,
}

pub enum ComplianceStatus {
    /// Transaction pending compliance review
    Pending,
    /// Transaction approved and compliant
    Approved,
    /// Transaction flagged for review
    Flagged,
    /// Transaction rejected due to compliance issues
    Rejected,
}
```

## Bank Mesh Network

### Inter-Bank Communication

The Bank Mesh Network enables secure communication and coordination between participating banks:

```rust
pub struct BankMeshNetwork {
    /// Network configuration
    config: BankMeshConfig,
    /// Local bank node information
    local_bank: BankNode,
    /// Connected bank nodes
    connected_banks: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<Uuid, BankNode>>>,
    /// Active consensus proposals
    active_proposals: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<Uuid, ConsensusProposal>>>,
    /// Liquidity sharing agreements
    liquidity_agreements: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<Uuid, LiquiditySharingAgreement>>>,
    /// Pending settlement transactions
    pending_settlements: Arc<RwLock<Vec<InterBankTransaction>>>,
}
```

### Bank Node Structure

Each bank in the mesh network is represented by a comprehensive node structure:

```rust
pub struct BankNode {
    /// Unique bank identifier
    pub id: Uuid,
    /// Bank name
    pub name: String,
    /// Network endpoint for communication
    pub endpoint: String,
    /// Public key for cryptographic operations
    pub public_key: String,
    /// Stake amount in the network
    pub stake_amount: Decimal,
    /// Reputation score based on performance
    pub reputation_score: Decimal,
    /// Last seen timestamp
    pub last_seen: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Current bank status
    pub status: BankStatus,
    /// Supported token types
    pub supported_tokens: Vec<TokenType>,
    /// Available liquidity pools
    pub liquidity_pools: HashMap<TokenType, Decimal>,
}
```

### Bank Status Management

Banks can have various statuses within the mesh network:

```rust
pub enum BankStatus {
    /// Fully operational and participating
    Active,
    /// Temporarily inactive
    Inactive,
    /// Suspended due to compliance issues
    Suspended,
    /// Penalized for network violations
    Slashed,
    /// Currently joining the network
    Joining,
    /// In process of leaving the network
    Leaving,
}
```

    "total_volume": 100000.00
  }
}
```

## Settlement Phases and Workflow

### Settlement Lifecycle

Bank settlements follow a structured multi-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiated**: Settlement request created and validated
2. **Coin Transfer**: Settlement coins (AUR/SC4) minted and transferred
3. **Clearing**: Banks process internal clearing operations
4. **Completed**: Settlement finalized and coins burned

### Phase Transition Validation

```rust
impl BankApiIntegration {
    fn is_valid_phase_transition(
        &self,
        current_phase: &SettlementPhase,
        new_phase: &SettlementPhase,
    ) -> Result<bool, BankApiError> {
        match (current_phase, new_phase) {
            (SettlementPhase::Initiated, SettlementPhase::CoinTransfer) => Ok(true),
            (SettlementPhase::CoinTransfer, SettlementPhase::Clearing) => Ok(true),
            (SettlementPhase::Clearing, SettlementPhase::Completed) => Ok(true),
            // Allow reverting to previous phases for error handling
            (SettlementPhase::Clearing, SettlementPhase::CoinTransfer) => Ok(true),
            (SettlementPhase::CoinTransfer, SettlementPhase::Initiated) => Ok(true),
            _ => Ok(false),
        }
    }
}
```

## Liquidity Sharing Network

### Inter-Bank Liquidity Requests

Banks can request liquidity from other network participants:

```rust
pub enum BankMessage {
    LiquidityRequest {
        request_id: Uuid,
        requesting_bank: Uuid,
        token_type: TokenType,
        amount: Decimal,
        interest_rate: Decimal,
        duration: Duration,
    },
    LiquidityOffer {
        request_id: Uuid,
        offering_bank: Uuid,
        token_type: TokenType,
        amount: Decimal,
        interest_rate: Decimal,
        conditions: Vec<String>,
    },
}
```

### Liquidity Sharing Agreements

Formal agreements govern liquidity sharing between banks:

```rust
pub struct LiquiditySharingAgreement {
    /// Unique agreement identifier
    pub id: Uuid,
    /// Bank providing liquidity
    pub provider_bank: Uuid,
    /// Bank receiving liquidity
    pub receiver_bank: Uuid,
    /// Token type being shared
    pub token_type: TokenType,
    /// Amount of liquidity
    pub amount: Decimal,
    /// Interest rate for the liquidity
    pub interest_rate: Decimal,
    /// Agreement duration
    pub duration: Duration,
    /// Agreement creation time
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Agreement expiration time
    pub expires_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Current agreement status
    pub status: AgreementStatus,
    /// Terms and conditions
    pub conditions: Vec<String>,
}
```

## Consensus and Governance

### Network Consensus Mechanism

The bank mesh network uses consensus for important decisions:

```rust
pub struct ConsensusProposal {
    /// Unique proposal identifier
    pub id: Uuid,
    /// Bank that created the proposal
    pub proposer: Uuid,
    /// Type of proposal
    pub proposal_type: ProposalType,
    /// Proposal description
    pub description: String,
    /// Proposal creation time
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Voting deadline
    pub voting_deadline: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Current votes
    pub votes: HashMap<Uuid, ConsensusVote>,
    /// Required consensus threshold
    pub required_consensus: Decimal,
    /// Current proposal status
    pub status: ProposalStatus,
}

pub enum ProposalType {
    /// Change network parameters
    ParameterChange { parameter: String, new_value: String },
    /// Add new bank to network
    BankAddition { bank_id: Uuid, bank_info: BankNode },
    /// Remove bank from network
    BankRemoval { bank_id: Uuid, reason: String },
    /// Update settlement limits
    SettlementLimitUpdate { new_limits: SettlementLimits },
    /// Emergency network action
    EmergencyAction { action: String, justification: String },
}
```

## Compliance and Security

### Compliance Validation

All banking operations undergo comprehensive compliance validation:

```rust
impl BankApiIntegration {
    async fn validate_compliance(
        &self,
        payment: &ConsumerPayment,
        bank_a: &BankApiConnection,
        bank_b: &BankApiConnection,
    ) -> Result<(), BankApiError> {
        // Check transaction limits
        if payment.amount > bank_a.license_info.settlement_limits.max_single_settlement {
            return Err(BankApiError::ComplianceViolation(
                "Amount exceeds bank A settlement limits".to_string()
            ));
        }
        
        // Validate compliance levels
        let required_level = self.get_required_compliance_level(&payment.amount)?;
        if !self.check_compliance_level(&bank_a.license_info.compliance_level, &required_level) {
            return Err(BankApiError::InsufficientCompliance(
                format!("Bank A compliance level insufficient: required {}, got {}", 
                    required_level, bank_a.license_info.compliance_level)
            ));
        }
        
        // Additional compliance checks...
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
