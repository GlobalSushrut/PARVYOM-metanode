# Technical Architecture

## System Overview

PARVYOM Metanode consists of two main layers that work together to provide enterprise blockchain infrastructure orchestration:

### BPI Core - Infrastructure Foundation

The BPI (Blockchain Protocol Infrastructure) Core provides the foundational services:

```
BPI Infrastructure Services (Ports 9001-9007)
├── Blockchain/Ledger Service    (Port 9001) - Core ledger operations
├── Oracle Node Service          (Port 9002) - External data integration  
├── Registry Service             (Port 9003) - Service discovery
├── Storage Service              (Port 9005) - Distributed data storage
├── Proof Verification Service   (Port 9006) - Cryptographic validation
└── Economic Coordination        (Port 9007) - Token economics
```

### BPCI Enterprise - Orchestration Layer

The BPCI (Blockchain Protocol Coordination Infrastructure) Enterprise layer coordinates and orchestrates the BPI services:

```
BPCI Application Layer (Port 8080)
├── Community Installer Web     - Management interface
├── BPCI Consensus Server       - Consensus coordination
├── Auction Mempool System      - Transaction ordering
├── Round Table Oracle          - Multi-chain coordination  
├── CueDB Database System       - Audit trail storage
└── Economic Distribution       - Automated economics
```

## Key Components

### Consensus Mechanisms
- **IBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** - Immediate finality consensus
- **HotStuff** - High-performance BFT consensus
- **Auction-based ordering** - Economic transaction prioritization

### Security Framework
- **ENC Lock + TSLPS** - Military-grade security architecture
- **Post-quantum cryptography** - Future-proof encryption
- **Domain-separated hashing** - Cryptographic isolation
- **Zero-trust architecture** - Every component authenticated

### Storage Systems
- **CueDB** - High-performance distributed database
- **Shadow Registry** - Web2-Web3 bridge storage
- **Distributed ledger** - Blockchain data storage
- **Audit trails** - Immutable compliance logs

### Networking
- **XTMP Protocol** - High-performance messaging (10-20x faster than HTTP)
- **HTTP Cage** - Security-enhanced HTTP processing
- **Multi-chain bridges** - Cross-blockchain communication
- **Load balancing** - Intelligent traffic distribution

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Setup
- Local development environment
