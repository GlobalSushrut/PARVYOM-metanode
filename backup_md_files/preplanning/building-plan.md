# **Phase F: Metanode BISO Security & Compliance Architecture** (3 weeks)

*A unified framework for verifiable, policy-enforced, zero-trust data movement.*

## **Core Concept**

Metanode BISO is a **policy-as-code + cryptographic proof system** for controlling **how, where, and why data flows** — and proving compliance in real time.
It introduces:

1. **Traffic Light Data Flow Pipeline** — real-time allow/review/block decisions.
2. **BISO (Block ISO)** — a Terraform-like compliance rule language.
3. **Packet Envelope** — tamper-proof, cryptographically signed transport wrapping.
4. **Bus BIOS in BIOS** — a secure, policy-aware execution bus for moving data between services and nodes.
5. **Blockbook & Audit Book** — immutable compliance ledgers and regulator-ready reports.

## **Traffic Light Data Flow Pipeline**

**Purpose:**
Visually and operationally control every piece of data in motion.

| Color      | Meaning         | Action     | Security Behavior                                          |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Green**  | Fully compliant | Pass       | Encrypt in transit (XChaCha20-Poly1305) + log to Blockbook |
| **Yellow** | Requires review | Quarantine | Route to secure inspection buffer, apply enhanced scanning |
| **Red**    | Violation       | Block      | Stop packet, generate violation receipt, trigger SOC alert |

**CLI Monitoring:**
```bash
biso watch --traffic
```

**Dashboard View:** World map + policy overlay, showing real-time flow status.

## **BISO — Block ISO**

A **machine-enforceable security compliance standard**.

### **Policy Syntax Example**

```hcl
policy "customer_pii" {
  classification  = "PII"
  allowed_regions = ["eu-central", "eu-west"]
  blocked_regions = ["us-east", "cn-north"]
  encryption      = "xchacha20-poly1305"
  retention_days  = 30
  allow_purpose   = ["billing"]
  deny_purpose    = ["marketing", "training"]
  require_consent = true
  block_on_violation = true
}
```

**Capabilities:**
* **Classification-aware** (PII, PHI, PCI).
* **Jurisdiction control** for GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
* **Purpose binding** for ethical/legal intent.
* **Consent enforcement** before movement.
* **Auto-blocking** with receipts for violations.

## **Packet Envelope**

A **cryptographically sealed wrapper** for every piece of data in motion.

### **Envelope Structure**

```json
{
  "packet_id": "pkt_93dks8",
  "origin": "svc.analytics-01",
  "classification": "PII",
  "biso_policy_hash": "blake3:abc123...",
  "payload_hash": "blake3:def456...",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T14:11:23Z",
  "signature": "ed25519:0x39f..."
}
```

**Security Features:**
* Payload is encrypted and hashed.
* Metadata contains **policy reference** and compliance state.
* Signatures prevent tampering.
* Can be verified independently by any node or auditor.

## **Bus BIOS in BIOS**

A **secure execution and routing bus** built into the BIOS layer of the Metanode OS.

* **First BIOS:** Base node firmware ensuring hardware trust (TPM/secure boot).
* **Second BIOS ("Bus BIOS"):** A micro-OS for:
  * Executing BISO policies before data hits the OS or apps.
  * Routing Packet Envelopes according to the Traffic Light state.
  * Isolating policy execution from compromised OS layers.

**Security Outcome:**
Even if the main OS is compromised, **Bus BIOS** continues enforcing policies and producing valid receipts.

## **Blockbook & Audit Book**

* **Blockbook:** Immutable, append-only ledger of all data flow events, policy checks, and routing decisions.
* **Audit Book:** Filtered version for regulators/auditors — includes only required metadata.

**Blockbook Entry Example:**

```json
{
  "flow_id": "flw_8128",
  "packet_id": "pkt_93dks8",
  "policy_id": "customer_pii",
  "action": "blocked",
  "reason": "region_not_allowed",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T14:12:33Z",
  "signatures": {
    "validator": "bls:0x9f8...",
    "gateway": "ed25519:0x23a..."
  }
}
```

## **End-to-End Data Flow**

1. **Packet Creation:**
   Data generated → classified → wrapped in Packet Envelope.
2. **Bus BIOS Enforcement:**
   Reads policy hash from envelope → runs BISO policy → assigns Traffic Light state.
3. **Routing Decision:**
   * Green → Send + log.
   * Yellow → Quarantine + review.
   * Red → Block + alert.
4. **Ledger Entry:**
   Decision written to Blockbook + optional Audit Book export.
5. **Receipt Issuance:**
   Encrypted proof sent to data owner + compliance team.

## **Why This Is Practical & World-Ready**

* **Hardware-rooted trust** → via Bus BIOS.
* **Full traceability** → Packet Envelope + Blockbook.
* **Policy-as-code** → easy updates, version control, automation.
* **Cross-industry fit** → finance, healthcare, gov, AI pipelines.
* **Regulator adoption potential** → BISO could become the standard for lawful, ethical, provable data flow.

💡 **Bottom line:**
This combined **BISO + Traffic Light + Packet Envelope + Bus BIOS** architecture doesn't just secure data — it creates **a global compliance and trust protocol** that could become *the* ISO of secure data movement.

## **ECONOMIC FOUNDATION: BankCoin & Gold Bridge System**

### **Core Philosophy: Metanode Community Economics**

The BankCoin system is the **primary economic engine** for managing the Metanode community and ecosystem. All other implementations are secondary to this core mission of:

- **Community Governance**: Coin holders participate in Metanode protocol decisions
- **Economic Incentives**: Reward network participants (miners, validators, developers)
- **Resource Allocation**: Fund development, infrastructure, and community initiatives
- **Value Capture**: Align economic incentives with network growth and adoption

---

## **BankCoin & Gold Bridge System – Complete Technical Build Blueprint**

### **PART 1 – CONCEPT FOUNDATION**

#### 1.1 **Core Philosophy**

* **One global coin**: Issued only against **real fiat/gold deposits** by regulated bank-validators.
* **Value from two sources**:
  1. **Work performed (PoE)** — coins must process real Metanode economic activity.
  2. **Permanent locked reserve** — every coin carries a non-spendable gold-equivalent value.
* **Cross-border via gold bridge** — no secondary volatile coin; settlement in gold numéraire.
* **Supply growth tied to Metanode growth** — new coins only when PoE passes issuance thresholds.

#### 1.2 **Key Actors in Metanode Ecosystem**

| Actor                            | Role                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Banks ($\mathcal{B}$)**      | Mint/burn coins for fiat deposits; manage reserves; execute cross-border gold settlements. |
| **Miners ($\mathcal{M}$)**     | Process Metanode jobs, maintain infrastructure, earn spendable rewards.                             |
| **Validators ($\mathcal{V}$)** | Approve transactions, maintain ledger consensus, receive gift emissions.                   |
| **Metanode Protocol**            | Core on-chain logic enforcing PoE, coin state, issuance rules.                             |

#### 1.3 **Coin Types for Community Management**

1. **Mother Bond Coins (MBC)** – genesis roots; highest prestige; governance voting power; only they can spawn new branches.
2. **Branch Coins** – minted by MBCs when PoE growth allows; community rewards and incentives.
3. **Leaf Coins** – minted by branches under stricter rules; operational payments and micro-transactions.

### **PART 2 – MATHEMATICAL & ECONOMIC LOGIC**

#### 2.1 **Per-Coin Variables**

For coin $c$ at epoch $t$:

* $L_c(t)$ — locked reserve (gold numéraire).
* $S_c(t)$ — spendable balance.
* $A_c(t)$ — state (empty/active).
* $\pi_c$ — parent coin ID.
* $\rho_c(t)$ — prestige weight (governance power).
* $\kappa_c$ — fiat anchor tag.

#### 2.2 **Activation by Work (PoE) - Metanode Specific**

1. Metanode job value in fiat $V_x$ → convert to gold:
   $V_g = V_x \cdot \mathsf{FX}_{x \to g}(t)$
2. Fee: $\text{Fee} = f \cdot V_g$
3. Lock increment: $\Delta L_c = \alpha \cdot \text{Fee}$ (or fixed $\ell$)
4. Spendable increment: $(\text{MinerShare} - \Delta L_c)$
5. Update state: $L_c \gets L_c + \Delta L_c$; $S_c \gets S_c + \dots$

#### 2.3 **PoE Index Formula for Metanode Network**

$$
\Phi(t) = w_V \cdot \frac{\sum_{\text{metanode jobs}} V_g}{\text{scale}_V}
+ w_L \cdot \frac{\sum_c \Delta L_c}{\text{scale}_L}
+ w_U \cdot \frac{\sum_v \text{uptime}_v}{|\mathcal{V}| T}
+ w_Q \cdot \text{QualityScore}(t)
$$

**Purpose:** Only if $\Phi(t) \ge \tau_k$ can new coins be issued to fund community initiatives.

#### 2.4 **Issuance Rules for Community Growth**

* **Root issuance** (MBC → branch):
  $n_r(t) = \min(\lfloor \beta \rho_r(t) \Gamma(\Phi(t)) \rfloor, q_{\max})$
* **Branch issuance** (branch → leaf):
  $n_b(t) = \min(\lfloor \gamma \rho_b(t) \Gamma(\Phi(t)) \rfloor, q'_{\max})$

### **PART 3 – SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

#### 3.1 **Core Components**

1. **Ledger Layer** (custom chain or on top of existing PoS/L1)
   * BLS-signed blocks
   * State machine for coins ($L_c$, $S_c$, $A_c$)
   * Governance voting mechanisms

2. **Bank Integration Layer**
   * API endpoints for mint/burn
   * Secure fiat reserve audit feed
   * FX + gold price oracles

3. **Metanode Job Processing Layer**
   * PoE job assignment logic
   * Fee calculation & distribution
   * Community reward distribution

4. **Compliance Layer**
   * AML/KYC policy engine (on/off-chain hybrid)
   * ZK-proof receipt generator

5. **Settlement Layer**
   * Domestic redemption path
   * Cross-border gold bridge path

#### 3.2 **Data Structures**

**Coin Table**
| coin_id | parent_id | type | L_c | S_c | state | anchor_fiat | prestige | governance_weight |

**Metanode Job Table**
| job_id | coin_id | value_fiat | value_gold | fee | lock_inc | miner_id | timestamp | job_type |

**Bank Reserve Table**
| bank_id | fiat_code | reserve_amt | reserve_gold | last_audit |

**Community Governance Table**
| proposal_id | coin_id | vote_weight | vote_choice | timestamp |

#### 3.3 **APIs**

### **PART 4 – ALGORITHMIC FLOW**

#### 4.1 **Metanode Job Processing**

```pseudo
function processMetanodeJob(c, Vx, fiatCode, jobType, t):
    Vg = Vx * FX[fiatCode->gold](t)
    fee = f * Vg
    miner_share = f_m * Vg
    lock_inc = alpha * fee
    community_share = f_c * Vg  // For community treasury
    
    L[c] += lock_inc
    S[c] += miner_share - lock_inc
    CommunityTreasury += community_share
    
    recordReceipt(c, Vg, fee, lock_inc, jobType)
    updateGovernanceWeight(c, lock_inc)
```

#### 4.2 **Cross-Border Settlement for Metanode**

```pseudo
function settleCrossBorder(c, fromFiat, toFiat, amtX, t):
    amtG = amtX * FX[fromFiat->gold](t)
    goldClear(fromBank=anchor(c), toBank=destBank, amtG)
    amtY = amtG * FX[gold->toFiat](t)
    creditRecipient(amtY)
    recordSettlementReceipt(c, fromFiat, toFiat, amtX, amtY, amtG)
```
