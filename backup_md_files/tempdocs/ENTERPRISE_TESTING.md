# 🛡️ MILITARY-GRADE ENTERPRISE TESTING SUITE

## 🎯 Testing Objective
Verify Metanode BPCI server and installer separation meets military-grade enterprise standards for:
- **Security** (cryptographic integrity, zero-trust architecture)
- **Scalability** (enterprise deployment readiness)
- **Reliability** (fault tolerance, disaster recovery)
- **Compliance** (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI DSS ready)
- **Performance** (sub-second finality, high throughput)

## 📋 Test Categories

### 1. 🏗️ Architecture Separation Tests
### 2. 🔒 Security & Cryptography Tests  
### 3. 🚀 Performance & Scalability Tests
### 4. 🛡️ Enterprise Compliance Tests
### 5. 🔧 Operational Readiness Tests
