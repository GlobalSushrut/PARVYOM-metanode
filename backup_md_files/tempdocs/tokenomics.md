# üè¶ **Metanode Tokenomics: Complete Economic Framework**

## **Executive Summary**

The Metanode protocol implements a **three-tier token hierarchy** backed by real-world assets and governed by Proof of Economic Activity (PoE). This system bridges traditional banking with decentralized finance through gold-backed settlements and community-driven governance.

- **Symbol**: GEN
- **Type**: Governance & Genesis Layer
- **Tagline**: "The Foundation of Metanode"
- **Purpose**: Highest prestige, governance voting power, can spawn new branches

### **2. NEXUS (NEX) - Branch Coins**  
- **Symbol**: NEX

## **üìä Mathematical Framework**

### **Core Variables (Per Coin)**

For coin `c` at epoch `t`:

```
Lc(t) = Lock value (permanent gold-equivalent reserve)
Sc(t) = Spendable balance (available for transactions)  
Ac(t) = Anchor fiat value (real-world backing)
œÄc = Parent coin ID (hierarchical structure)
Pc(t) = Prestige score (governance weight)
```

### **Proof of Economic Activity (PoE)**

```
Œ¶(t) = Œ£(all jobs j) [value_fiat(j) √ó gold_ratio(j) √ó lock_increment(j)]

Where:
- value_fiat(j) = Fiat value of work performed
- gold_ratio(j) = Gold backing percentage
- lock_increment(j) = Permanent lock increase
```

### **Issuance Threshold Formula**

```
New coin issuance allowed only if: Œ¶(t) ‚â• œÑk

Where:
- œÑk = Threshold for tier k (Genesis/Branch/Leaf)
- œÑGenesis > œÑBranch > œÑLeaf (decreasing thresholds)
```

### **Governance Weight Calculation**

```
Voting_Power(c) = Lc(t) √ó Pc(t) √ó Tier_Multiplier

Where:
- Genesis: Tier_Multiplier = 10.0
- Branch: Tier_Multiplier = 3.0  
- Leaf: Tier_Multiplier = 1.0
```

---

## **üèóÔ∏è Internal Infrastructure Use**

### **1. Validator Economics**
```
Validator Rewards = Base_Reward √ó (Stake_Weight + Diversity_Bonus + Performance_Bonus)

Where:
- Base_Reward: 100 NEX per epoch
- Stake_Weight: (validator_stake / total_stake) √ó 0.4
- Diversity_Bonus: Geographic/ASN diversity multiplier (0.1-0.3)
- Performance_Bonus: Uptime and response time multiplier (0.0-0.2)
```

### **2. Network Fee Structure**
```
Transaction_Fee = Base_Fee + (Data_Size √ó Data_Rate) + (Compute_Units √ó Compute_Rate)

Where:
- Base_Fee: 0.01 FLX
- Data_Rate: 0.001 FLX per KB
- Compute_Rate: 0.1 FLX per compute unit
```

### **3. Slashing Mechanics**
```
Slashing_Penalty = Min(Max_Slash, Violation_Severity √ó Stake_Amount √ó 0.05)

Where:
- Max_Slash: 10% of total stake
- Violation_Severity: 1.0 (minor) to 5.0 (critical)
- Slashed tokens are permanently burned
```

### **4. Staking Rewards Distribution**
```
Annual_Staking_Yield = 8% + Performance_Bonus + Diversity_Bonus

Distributed as:
- 60% NEX tokens (immediate)
- 30% GEN tokens (vested over 12 months)
- 10% AUR tokens (gold-backed reserves)
```

---

## **üåç External Use Cases**

### **1. Cross-Border Payments**
```
Settlement_Cost = Transfer_Amount √ó 0.001 + Fixed_Fee(0.1 AUR)

Benefits:
- Gold-backed stability
- Near-instant settlement
- Regulatory compliance
- Lower costs than traditional banking
```

### **2. DeFi Integration**
```
Lending_Rate = Base_Rate + Risk_Premium + Liquidity_Premium

Where:
- Base_Rate: 3-5% APY
- Risk_Premium: Based on collateral quality
- Liquidity_Premium: Market-driven adjustment
```

### **3. Community Governance**
```
Proposal_Threshold = 1,000 GEN tokens minimum
Voting_Quorum = 10% of total GEN supply
Execution_Threshold = 60% approval + quorum

Governance Areas:
- Protocol parameter updates
- Fee structure changes
- New feature proposals
- Treasury allocation
```

### **4. Merchant Payments**
```
Merchant_Fee = 0.5% (vs 2-3% traditional cards)
Settlement_Time = <2 seconds (vs 2-3 days traditional)
Chargeback_Protection = Smart contract escrow
Multi-currency_Support = Automatic conversion via AUR
```
