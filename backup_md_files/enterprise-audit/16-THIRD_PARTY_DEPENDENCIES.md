        // Test ring cryptographic operations
        let key = ring::signature::Ed25519KeyPair::generate_pkcs8(&ring::rand::SystemRandom::new()).unwrap();
        assert!(key.len() > 0);
        
        // Test blake3 hashing
        let hash = blake3::hash(b"test data");
        assert_eq!(hash.as_bytes().len(), 32);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_serialization_dependency_compatibility() {
        // Test serde serialization/deserialization
        #[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
        struct TestStruct {
            field: String,
        }
        
        let test_data = TestStruct { field: "test".to_string() };
        let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&test_data).unwrap();
        let deserialized: TestStruct = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();
