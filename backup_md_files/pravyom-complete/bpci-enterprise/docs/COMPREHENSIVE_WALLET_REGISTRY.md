## Economic Model

### Mother Coin Distribution
- **Primary Founder Wallet**: 600 mother coins
- **Other Owner Wallets**: 100 mother coins each
- **Total Allocation**: Based on owner type and wallet classification

### Baby Coin Generation
- **PoE Activities**: Generate baby coins with real value
- **Network Load**: Affects baby coin generation rate
- **Growth Formula**: `baby_coins = poe_activities √ó network_load √ó 0.001`
- **Value Accumulation**: More PoE ‚Üí More baby coins ‚Üí Higher wallet value

### Billing System
- **Testnet**: Free allocation, no billing, refundable
- **Mainnet**: $1.00/BPI default, real rent and gas fees, runtime-dependent pricing

## Compliance Framework

### Required Verifications for Mainnet
