# 📘 Advanced Logic, Mathematics, and Engineering Foundation for PreBinary Computing

## 🧠 Introduction

This document outlines the advanced logic, mathematical framework, and engineering infrastructure required to extend PreBinary computation into a fully functional, hardware-agnostic, symbolic-computing platform. It introduces the foundational components needed to integrate symbolic entropy, transition factor dynamics, void logic, and hardware-aware optimization into a cohesive engineering framework.

## 🔢 1. Mathematical Foundation of PreBinary

### 1.1 Morphon Units (M)

* Symbolic logic units.
* Represent abstract logic between binary and quantum.
* Morphon State: `{Collapsed, Superposition, Entangled}`.

### 1.2 Transition Number (Tⁿ)

* Encodes dynamic computation logic, rather than static 1/0.
* Represents factorial evolution of logic.
* Drives computation via `Tⁿ = f(θ, ∆, Σ)` where θ = knot phase, ∆ = displacement, Σ = entropy.

### 1.3 Knot-Trigonometric Logic

* Core function: `Ξ(t) = sec(θ) ⊗ Tⁿ ⊗ ∆𝔻`
* Embeds knot theory and chaos angle (Mock Angle) into logic flow.
* Allows oscillatory state calculation.

### 1.4 Category-Theoretic Displacement (∆𝔻)

* Replaces Euclidean distance in computation.
* Allows logic mobility across memory and entropy networks.

### 1.5 Symbolic Entropy (Σ)

* Drives logical state collapse.
* Engineered via real-time entropy of morphon system.
