## Integration Architecture

### How Components Work Together

1. **Application Deployment Flow**:
   ```
   SaaS App → ENC Cluster → Docklock Cage → Receipt Generation
   ```

2. **Consensus and Agreement Flow**:
   ```
   VRF Leader Selection → BPI Consensus → Agreement Enforcement → Receipt Verification
   ```

3. **Network Communication Flow**:
   ```
   BPCI Transport → Relay System → Anti-Eclipse Protection → Message Delivery
   ```

4. **Policy Enforcement Flow**:
   ```
   Agreements SDK → Court System → WASM Policy → Docklock Enforcement
   ```

### Key Integration Points

1. **ENC Cluster + Docklock**: ENC Cluster orchestrates workloads that run inside Docklock deterministic cages
2. **Agreements SDK + Court**: Policies are deployed to courts and enforced during execution
3. **VRF + BPI Consensus**: VRF provides randomness for leader selection in BPI consensus
4. **BPCI + Relay**: BPCI provides secure transport while Relay handles message distribution
5. **Receipt + All Components**: Receipts provide cryptographic verification for all operations

## Current Example 3 Gaps

### What We're Currently Using
- Simplified BPI consensus engines (HTTP servers)
- BPCI testnet simulation (Python HTTP server)
- Basic SaaS apps with direct HTTP API calls
- No real Docklock deterministic execution
- No agreement enforcement
- No receipt generation

### What We Should Be Using
- **Real Docklock Cages**: SaaS apps should run inside deterministic cages
- **ENC Cluster Orchestration**: Proper blockchain-native container orchestration
- **Agreements SDK**: Real policy deployment and enforcement
- **VRF Leader Selection**: Consensus should use VRF for leader selection
- **Receipt Generation**: All operations should generate cryptographic receipts
- **Court System**: Agreements should be hosted in courts with WASM policies
