"Never trust, always verify" - assumes breach and validates every transaction

### **Implementation Components**
- **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication for every access request
- **Device Trust**: Continuous device health and compliance monitoring
- **Network Microsegmentation**: Granular network access controls
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal permissions with just-in-time elevation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time behavior analysis and risk assessment

### **Expert Implementation**
```yaml
# BPI CUE Zero Trust Policy
zeroTrust: {
    identity: {
        mfa: "required"
        biometric: "preferred"
        riskScore: <0.3
    }
    network: {
        microsegmentation: "enabled"
        eastWestTraffic: "encrypted"
        defaultDeny: true
    }
    access: {
        justInTime: true
        sessionTimeout: "15m"
        continuousAuth: true
    }
}
```
