## Technical Architecture

### 1. Consensus-Driven Scheduling

#### 1.1 Scheduling Protocol
```rust
// Consensus-based workload scheduling
struct SchedulingDecision {
    workload_id: Uuid,
    target_node: NodeId,
    resource_allocation: ResourceSpec,
    consensus_round: u64,
    validator_signatures: Vec<BlsSignature>, // 2/3+ required
    scheduling_proof: MerkleProof,
}

// Enforcement: All scheduling requires consensus
```

#### 1.2 Resource Verification
```rust
// Cryptographic resource commitment
struct ResourceCommitment {
    node_id: NodeId,
    cpu_cores: u32,
    memory_bytes: u64,
    storage_bytes: u64,
    network_bandwidth: u64,
    commitment_signature: BlsSignature,
    attestation_proof: TpmAttestation,
}

// Enforcement: Resources must be cryptographically committed
```

#### 1.3 Workload Lifecycle Management
```rust
// Complete workload lifecycle tracking
enum WorkloadState {
    Pending,      // Awaiting scheduling decision
    Scheduled,    // Assigned to node via consensus
    Running,      // Executing on target node
    Completed,    // Finished successfully
    Failed,       // Execution failed
    Slashed,      // Violated agreement terms
}

// Enforcement: All state transitions via consensus
```

### 2. Service Mesh Architecture

#### 2.1 P2P Service Discovery
```rust
// Decentralized service discovery
struct ServiceEndpoint {
    service_id: Uuid,
    node_id: NodeId,
    endpoint_url: String,
    capabilities: Vec<String>,
    health_status: HealthStatus,
    bls_signature: BlsSignature,  // Cryptographic authenticity
    last_heartbeat: u64,
}

// Enforcement: All services must be cryptographically signed
```

#### 2.2 Encrypted Communication
```yaml
encryption_requirements:
  algorithm: "ChaCha20Poly1305"
  key_exchange: "X25519"
  authentication: "BLS12-381"
  forward_secrecy: true
  replay_protection: true
```

#### 2.3 Load Balancing Protocol
```rust
// Consensus-driven load balancing
struct LoadBalancingDecision {
    service_id: Uuid,
    routing_weights: HashMap<NodeId, f64>,
    consensus_round: u64,
    performance_metrics: ServiceMetrics,
    validator_approval: Vec<BlsSignature>,
}

// Enforcement: Load balancing decisions require consensus
```

### 3. Receipt-Based Auditing

#### 3.1 Operation Receipt Format
```rust
struct ClusterOperationReceipt {
    // Operation metadata
    operation_id: Uuid,
    operation_type: OperationType,
    timestamp: u64,
    block_height: u64,
    
    // Consensus proof
    consensus_round: u64,
    validator_signatures: Vec<BlsSignature>,
    merkle_proof: MerkleProof,
    
    // Resource usage
    cpu_time_used: u64,
    memory_peak: u64,
    network_bytes: u64,
    storage_operations: u64,
    
    // Cryptographic integrity
    operation_hash: [u8; 32],
    receipt_signature: Ed25519Signature,
    immutable: bool,
}
```

#### 3.2 Audit Trail Requirements
- **Complete Logging**: All cluster operations must generate receipts
