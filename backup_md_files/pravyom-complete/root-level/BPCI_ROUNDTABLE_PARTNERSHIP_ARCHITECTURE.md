# BPCI Enterprise Roundtable Partnership Architecture
## Mature Chain Partnership Program with 20% Revenue Sharing

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

BPCI Enterprise invites **mature blockchain networks** to join as **Roundtable Partners** in our revolutionary triple consensus architecture. Partners receive **20% of all earnings** (PoE mining rewards, rent, and auction revenues) in exchange for providing **zero-cost, gas-free proof retrieval** and maintaining **solid faith consensus validation**.

This partnership creates a **decentralized mesh of mature chains** working together to secure and validate BPCI's innovative auction-based consensus while sharing in the economic rewards.
