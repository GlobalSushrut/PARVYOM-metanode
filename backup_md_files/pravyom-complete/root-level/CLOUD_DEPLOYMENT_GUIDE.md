3. Sets up Python environment with GPU support
4. Installs all required packages:
   - XGBoost with GPU support
   - CuML/RAPIDS for GPU acceleration
   - CuPy for GPU arrays
   - All TabooMesh dependencies
5. Downloads NLTK data
6. Runs GPU-accelerated training
7. Downloads results back to local machine

### Phase 2: GPU-Accelerated Training

**Training Components:**
- **Breakthrough Features** (19): Proven 0.87 AUC baseline patterns
- **UTKGCE Features** (25): Advanced symbolic cognitive features
- **Pattern Graph Features** (10): Graph-based violation patterns
- **Rule Specialist Features** (8): Rule-specific detection
- **Feature Depth Features** (20): Deep semantic analysis
- **TF-IDF Features** (500): Optimized text vectorization

**Total Features:** 582 comprehensive features

**GPU-Accelerated Models:**
- XGBoost with `tree_method='gpu_hist'`
- CuML Random Forest (if GPU available)
- Optimized sklearn ensemble
- Adaptive ensemble weighting

## üîß Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If automatic deployment fails, use manual steps:

### 1. Connect to Cloud Server
```bash
ssh root@138.197.133.196
```

### 2. Upload Files
```bash
scp -r /home/umesh/Taboomesh root@138.197.133.196:/root/
```

### 3. Setup Environment
```bash
# On cloud server
cd /root/Taboomesh
python3 -m venv taboomesh_env
source taboomesh_env/bin/activate
pip install -r cloud_requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Training
```bash
PYTHONPATH=/root/Taboomesh python3 cloud_train_optimized.py
```

## üìä Expected Performance

### Target Metrics:
- **AUC:** 0.95+ (target breakthrough)
- **Baseline:** 0.87 AUC (current best)
- **Improvement:** +0.08 AUC minimum
- **Training Speed:** 10x faster with GPU

### Performance Monitoring:
- Real-time logging to `taboomesh_training.log`
- Cross-validation scores for each model
- Ensemble weight optimization
- GPU utilization tracking

## üé™ Model Architecture

### Ensemble Configuration:
```
Final Score = Œ£(weight_i √ó model_i_prediction)

Where:
- XGBoost GPU: Adaptive weight based on CV performance
- Random Forest: Adaptive weight based on CV performance  
- Logistic Regression: Adaptive weight based on CV performance
- Gradient Boosting: Adaptive weight based on CV performance
```

### Feature Integration:
```
Symbolic Features (82) + TF-IDF SVD (500) = 582 Total Features

Symbolic Breakdown:
- Breakthrough: 19 (proven violation patterns)
- UTKGCE: 25 (cognitive reasoning)
- Pattern Graph: 10 (graph analysis)
- Rule Specialist: 8 (rule-specific)
- Feature Depth: 20 (semantic depth)
```

## üèÜ Success Criteria

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **GPU Not Detected:**
   - Check `nvidia-smi` output
   - Verify CUDA installation
   - Fallback to CPU training

2. **Memory Issues:**
   - Reduce batch sizes in training script
   - Use feature selection more aggressively
   - Enable memory optimization flags

3. **Package Installation Failures:**
   - Use CPU alternatives (lightgbm, catboost)
   - Skip CuML if installation fails
   - Fallback to sklearn-only ensemble

4. **SSH Connection Issues:**
   - Verify server IP: `138.197.133.196`
   - Check SSH key authentication
   - Use password authentication if needed

## üìÅ Output Files

After successful deployment:

### On Cloud Server:
- `taboomesh_cloud_optimized_model.pkl` - Trained model
- `taboomesh_cloud_submission.csv` - Test predictions
- `taboomesh_training.log` - Training logs

### Downloaded Locally:
- `taboomesh_cloud_optimized_model.pkl` - Complete model
- `taboomesh_cloud_submission.csv` - Submission file

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Validate Performance:** Check if AUC ‚â• 0.95 achieved
2. **Analyze Results:** Review training logs and model performance
3. **Submit Predictions:** Use generated CSV for competition submission
4. **Optimize Further:** If target not reached, tune hyperparameters
5. **Production Deploy:** If successful, prepare for production deployment
