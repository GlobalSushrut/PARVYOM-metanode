# üéØ Roadmap to 0.95+ AUC - TabooMesh+++

## üìä **CURRENT STATUS**
- **Best AUC**: 0.8070-0.8218 (consistent ceiling)
- **Gap to Target**: 0.1282-0.1430 AUC points
- **Progress**: 85% complete

---

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Why We're Stuck at 0.80-0.82 AUC**

1. **Pattern Coverage Gap**: We have ~50 violation patterns, top performers likely have 500+
2. **Feature Engineering Depth**: Missing semantic, syntactic, and contextual features
3. **Model Architecture**: Not using state-of-the-art ensemble techniques
4. **Rule Specialization**: Generic approach instead of rule-specific models
5. **Data Quality**: Not leveraging full potential of available text data

---

## üöÄ **BREAKTHROUGH TECHNIQUES NEEDED**

### **1. MASSIVE PATTERN EXPANSION** 
**Impact**: +0.05-0.08 AUC

```python
# Current: ~50 patterns
legal_patterns = ['you should sue', 'get a lawyer', ...]

# Needed: 500+ patterns with variations
legal_patterns_expanded = [
    # Direct advice patterns
    'you should sue', 'you need to sue', 'you have to sue',
    'sue them', 'take them to court', 'file a lawsuit',
    
    # Professional claims
    'i am a lawyer', 'as a lawyer', 'speaking as an attorney',
    'i practice law', 'i work in legal', 'legal professional here',
    
    # Specific legal advice
    'statute of limitations', 'small claims court', 'civil lawsuit',
    'criminal charges', 'restraining order', 'cease and desist',
    
    # Variations and synonyms for EACH pattern
    # Misspellings, abbreviations, slang
]
```

### **2. ADVANCED FEATURE ENGINEERING**
**Impact**: +0.03-0.05 AUC

```python
# Semantic Features
- Word2Vec/GloVe embeddings (300D)
- Sentence-level embeddings
- Topic modeling (LDA) features

# Syntactic Features  
- POS tag sequences
- Dependency parse features
- Named entity recognition

# Contextual Features
- Sentence position in text
- Paragraph structure
- Response vs. original post
- Thread context

# Cross-Feature Interactions
- Pattern √ó Rule type combinations
- Authority claims √ó Legal patterns
- Certainty √ó Violation intensity
```

### **3. RULE-SPECIFIC SPECIALIZATION**
**Impact**: +0.04-0.06 AUC

```python
# Instead of one model, train specialized models:
legal_model = train_legal_specialist(legal_data, legal_features)
advertising_model = train_advertising_specialist(ad_data, ad_features)
harassment_model = train_harassment_specialist(harassment_data, harassment_features)

# Final prediction combines specialists
final_prediction = ensemble_specialists(legal_pred, ad_pred, harassment_pred)
```

### **4. ADVANCED MODEL ARCHITECTURES**
**Impact**: +0.02-0.04 AUC

```python
# Gradient Boosting with proper tuning
xgb_model = XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=2000,
    max_depth=8,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8
)

# Neural network ensemble
nn_model = MLPClassifier(
    hidden_layer_sizes=(512, 256, 128),
    dropout=0.3,
    batch_normalization=True
)

# Stacked ensemble with meta-learner
meta_model = train_meta_learner([rf_pred, xgb_pred, nn_pred])
```

### **5. DATA AUGMENTATION**
**Impact**: +0.02-0.03 AUC

```python
# Text normalization
normalized_text = normalize_text(raw_text)  # Fix spelling, expand abbreviations

# Synthetic data generation
synthetic_violations = generate_synthetic_violations(existing_patterns)

# Balanced sampling
balanced_data = balance_violation_types(train_data)
```

1. **Massive Pattern Libraries**: 1000+ violation patterns with variations
2. **Ensemble of Specialists**: Separate models per violation type
3. **Advanced NLP Features**: Embeddings, syntax, context
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Bayesian optimization across all parameters
5. **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic violation generation
6. **Cross-Validation Strategy**: Stratified by rule type and subreddit

## üí° **KEY INSIGHTS**

### **Why 0.80-0.82 is a Ceiling:**
- **Generic Approach**: One-size-fits-all model can't capture rule-specific nuances

- **Feature Limitations**: Not leveraging full semantic and syntactic richness of text

### **How to Break Through:**
- **Specialization**: Rule-specific models and features
- **Pattern Density**: Comprehensive violation phrase coverage
- **Advanced ML**: State-of-the-art ensemble techniques
