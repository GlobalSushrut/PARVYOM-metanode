# Bank Mesh Architecture: Real Autonomous Economy Infrastructure
## Notary-Based Banking for Real Economic Transactions

### **Executive Summary**

The Bank Mesh is a revolutionary notary-based banking system that creates real autonomous economy infrastructure within the BPCI network. This system enables real banks, real economy transactions, autonomous financial services, and complete economic governance - transforming the blockchain from theoretical economic incentives into a fully functional financial ecosystem.

## **Bank Mesh Core Architecture**

### **Governance & Authority Structure**

```rust
pub struct BpciHeadquarters {
    /// Project owner's core infrastructure
    owner_core_systems: OwnerCoreSystemsManager,
    /// Real bank wallet offered by project owner
    owner_bank_wallet: RealBankWallet,
    /// Central authority and governance
    central_authority: CentralAuthoritySystem,
    /// Integration with all BPCI components
    bpci_integration: BpciIntegrationManager,
}

pub struct NaNNode {
    /// Node identification in BPCI network
    node_id: NaNNodeId,
    /// Managed by notary validator committee
    notary_validator_committee: NotaryValidatorCommittee,
    /// Authority delegation to bank autonomy
    bank_autonomy_authority: BankAutonomyAuthority,
    /// Connection to BPI shared nodes
    bpi_shared_nodes: Vec<BpiSharedNode>,
    /// Integration with BPCI headquarters
    headquarters_connection: BpciHeadquartersConnection,
}

pub struct BankAutonomyAuthority {
    /// Authority held by bank autonomy system
    autonomy_level: AutonomyLevel,
    /// Handled by BPI shared nodes
    bpi_shared_node_handlers: Vec<BpiSharedNodeHandler>,
    /// Real bank wallet integration
    real_bank_wallet: RealBankWalletIntegration,
    /// Project owner authority delegation
    owner_authority_delegation: OwnerAuthorityDelegation,
}
```

### **Bank Mesh Components**

```rust
pub struct BankMesh {
    /// BPCI Headquarters (owner's core systems)
    bpci_headquarters: BpciHeadquarters,
    /// NaN Node with governance structure
    nan_node: NaNNode,
    /// Bank autonomy authority system

    /// Real economy transaction processor
    transaction_processor: RealEconomyTransactionProcessor,
    /// Autonomous financial services
    financial_services: AutonomousFinancialServices,
    /// Economic governance and policy
    economic_governance: EconomicGovernanceSystem,

## **Integration with BPI Ecosystem**

### **Bank Mesh Integration Points**

1. **BPCI Network Integration**
   - Bank Mesh operates as core component of BPCI
   - All economic transactions recorded in BPCI blockchain
   - Notary nodes participate in BPCI consensus

2. **Court Node Integration**
   - SmartContracts++ economic terms enforced by Bank Mesh
   - Court arbitration decisions affect banking operations
   - Compliance policies integrated with banking services

3. **BPI Parachain Integration**
   - Bank Mesh provides economic infrastructure for BPI operations
   - Cross-chain economic transactions between BPI instances
   - Economic incentives for BPI validators and miners

4. **HTTP Cage Integration**
   - Banking API calls secured through HTTP Cage
   - All financial communications cryptographically verified
   - Economic transactions for HTTP Cage services
