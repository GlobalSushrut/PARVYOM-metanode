## 🚀 **Implementation Priority (Critical 30%)**

4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline verification

### **Phase 2: Economic Engine (Week 2)**
1. **PoE Math Implementation**: Deterministic Φ/Γ calculator with golden tests
2. **NEX Minting**: Real token creation based on resource usage
3. **Fee Distribution**: Owner earnings and treasury management
4. **Bank Mesh Integration**: Multi-token balance and settlement

### **Phase 3: Policy & Governance (Week 3)**
1. **Court Compiler**: YAML → JSON state machine
2. **Policy Enforcement**: Real-time rule execution
3. **HTTP Cage**: Unified API gateway with auth/rate limiting
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete query and reporting system

## 📊 **Deployment Readiness**

### **Current State**
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: 100% ready
- ✅ **Blockchain Core**: 100% ready
- ❌ **Business Logic**: 30% ready (critical gap)
- ❌ **Integration**: 20% ready (major gap)

### **v1.0 Target**
- 🎯 **Full Pipeline**: StepReceipt → LogBlock → PoE → BPCI blocks
- 🎯 **Real Economics**: NEX minting, fee splits, owner earnings
- 🎯 **Policy Engine**: YAML smart contracts with enforcement
- 🎯 **Production Ready**: <30min onboarding, enterprise SLOs

The architecture is solid, the infrastructure is complete, but we need to implement the core business logic that makes it a real blockchain with economic incentives and policy enforcement. This is the critical 30% that transforms our infrastructure into a working v1.0 system.
