### CUE-Based YAML Contract Example
```cue
// court-contracts/sla-enforcement.cue
package court

sla_contract: {
    name: "SLAEnforcement"
    version: "1.0"
    
    triggers: [
        {
            event: "processing_timeout"
            condition: "processing_time > 30s"
            action: "slash_10_percent"
            penalty_amount: 0.1
        },
        {
            event: "data_breach"
            condition: "privacy_violation_detected == true"
            action: "emergency_halt"
            penalty_amount: 1.0
        }
    ]
    
    // Auto-generates YAML smart contract for Court Node
    // Auto-generates Solidity contract for blockchain
    // Auto-generates enforcement policies for all components
}
```

**Generated Output:**
- `generated/yaml/sla-enforcement.yaml` (Court Node)
- `generated/solidity/SLAEnforcement.sol` (Blockchain)
- `generated/policies/sla-policies.json` (System-wide)
